### *Definitions:*  
***Most favoured Nations tariff (MFN):***  
Tariff that WTO member countries promise to impose all of their trading partners who are also WTO members, unless the country is part of a preferential trade agreement (such as a free trade area or customs union). This means that, in practice, MFN rates are the highest (most restrictive) tariffs that WTO members charge one another.

***Preferential tariff:***  
Tariff that falls under a preferential trade agreement, where countries agree to charge a lower rate than the MFN rate.
