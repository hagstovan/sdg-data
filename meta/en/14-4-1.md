### Text answer  

"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has the responsibility for global monitoring. To this end the statuses of the most important fish stocks in each country are evaluated with respect to maximum sustainable yield (MSY).

Faroe Marine Research Institute carries out assessment of 13 commercially exploited fish stocks, 10 of which are reviewed by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) according to MSY. Two additional fish stocks with no fixed MSY are reviewed by ICES. The catch of the aforementioned 10 stocks represented ~95% of the total catch of the Faroese fishing fleet in the period 2018-2022 and 9 of them are deemed above the MSY-threshold."
