## Text answer  
Faroe Islands has since 1994 granted money on the budget to further gender equality.  
From 1994 to the *Gender Equality Commission* whose mission is to eradicate all discrimination by reason of gender; and from 2005 to *Demokratia* that is working to better women's representation in parliament and local governments.  
In 2019 gender equality were given a higher priority by granting additional 250,000 DKK on the budget and a gender equality office were established.  
There are, however, no special systems to track allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment
