## Text answer  
Faroe Islands has since 1994 granted money on the budget to further gender equality.  
From 1994 to the Gender Equality Commission whose mission is to eradicate all discrimination by reason of gender; and from 2005 to Demokratia that is working to better women's representation in parliament and local governments.  
In 2019 gender equality were given a higher priority by granting additional 250,000 DKK on the budget and a gender equality office were established.  
There are, however, no special systems to track allocations for gender equality and women's empowerment
