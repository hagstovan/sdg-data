## Text answer  
There exists no Faroese strategy for youth employment. Many municipalities do, however, have an initiative called 'Young in work' where young people for a couple of weeks get the opportunity to gain their first working experience.  
In addition an existing law on employment promoting has a number of measures enabling persons with limited working ability to stay in the labour force, e.g. financial support for education and training.
