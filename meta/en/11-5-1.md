## Text answer  
A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts that exceed the societyâ€™s ability to cope using its own resources.
No official statistics are compiled on the number of dead, missing and affected persons in connection with disasters. However, Statistics Faroe Islands estimates that the numbers are very small.
