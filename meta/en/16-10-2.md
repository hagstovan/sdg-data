## Text answer  
The constitution guarantees any person the right to publish his or her ideas in print, in writing, and in speech.  
According to The Information Act any person can demand access to documents that an authority has received or produced as part of its administrative case handling.  
Complaints against decisions on applications for access can be lodged to the authority or appealed to The Parliamentary Ombudsman that is monitoring the public administration.
