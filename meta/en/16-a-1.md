## Text answer  
In Faroe Islands there is no independent national human rights institution in compliance with the Paris Principles.  
A National Human Rights Institution is an independent administrative body set up by a State to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However, they operate and function independently from government.
