#### Definition 
The Red List Index measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (www.iucnredlist.org)

***The index is calculated based on these weight categories:***   
  *Least Concerned:*  **0**   
  *Near Threatened:*  **1**   
  *Vulnerable:*  **2**   
  *Endangered:*  **3**   
  *Critically Endangered:*  **4**   
  *Possibly Extinct:*  **5**   
The Red List Index has a value between 0 (all *possibly extinct*) og 1 (all *least concern*)  

#### Red List Index for Faroe Islands is based on 23 mammal species and 61 bird species
**95% confidence intervals** are calculated to take into account the  
 • number of data deficient species and  
 • the uncertainty over exactly when changes in status occurred (given that assessments are repeated only at multi-year intervals)  
Therefore the precise value for any particular year is uncertain.
