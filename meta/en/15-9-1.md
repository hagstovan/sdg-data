## Text answer  
Faroe Islands have not committed itself to the Aichi Biodiversity target 2 and are not using national environmental-economic accounting.  
A proposed law on environmental biodiversity was tabled in the parliament in 2018 and 2021, but has never been passed.  
Faroe Islands therefore do not comply with this indicator.
