## Text answer  
In May 2023 the parliament, Løgtingið, enacted *Law on Protection of Nature*, where one of the stated goals is to maintain biodiversity.  
Faroe Islands have, however, not committed itself to the Aichi Biodiversity target 2 and are not using national environmental-economic accounting.  
Faroe Islands therefore do not as yet comply with this indicator.
