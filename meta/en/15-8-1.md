## Text answer
In Faroe Islands it is legally prohibited to import and release exotic animals (which are not a natural part of the Faroese nature) into the Faroese nature, and prohibited to import dogs or cats without authorization from Faroese Food and Veterinary Authority.  
There are also regulations for handling of ballast water and sediments from ballast water on board Faroese vessels and platforms in order to prevent invasion and spreading of alien species according to the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments, 2004.  
Regulation on prevention and extermination of rats is intended to prevent spread of rats, especially to rat free islands, and to exterminate rats whereever found.
Faroe Islands have ratified The Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats that contains regulations on invasive alien species.  
According to environmental authorities the exisating legislation is incomplete having no rules limiting intended or unintended import of biological material save pets and ballast water, and no tools are available to deal with invasive species.
