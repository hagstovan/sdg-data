  The series that is representative for coastal areas has ben sampled in February when not disturbed by organic material from primary production  
  • The concentration of *nitrogen* seems relatively constant and shows no signs of eutrotrophication from anthropogenic sources  
  • The decreasing concentration of *silica* is due to large scale oceanographic changes and is not related to eutrotrophication
