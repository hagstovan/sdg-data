### Comments to indicator 14.1.1 (a)  

***Chlorophyll-a series:***  
  From UN environment programme (UNEP) based on assessment of ocean colour in satellite pictures. The area is the Exclusive Economic Zone  
  The series *Chlorophyll-a deviations* has been backcasted to include territorial waters.
These measurements show variations in quantity of phytoplankton  


***Nutrients in Skopun (coastal waters):***  
  The measurements representing coastal waters outside of the fjords are taken in February when not disturbed by primary production  

According to Faroe Marine Research Institute there is no basis to link the measurements of marine chlorophyll or nutrients in Skopun to eutrophication
