## Text answer
There are no forests in Faroe Islands, but there are about 25 larger and smaller plantations covering less than 0.1% of the total land area.  
  
According to the FAO, forest is defined as: *“land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use”.*
