## Text answer  
Currently, there exists no Faroese assessment in accordance with the definition for the indicator. Registration of all researchers in the Faroe Islands is however underway on the portal <i>pure.fo</i>, initiated by the University of the Faroe Islands, the National Library of the Faroe Islands, and Research Council Faroe Islands. Presently, there are 15 public research units and nearly 200 researchers represented. The aim is to include all relevant parties in the near future.
