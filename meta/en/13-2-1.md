Faroe Islands is committed to the Paris Agreement and reports annually on greenhouse gas emission to UNFCCC in accordance with the Paris Agreement.
However, Faroe Islands has not yet reported to UNFCCC the status concerning  
    • nationally determined contributions,  
    • long-term strategies,  
    • adaptation plans or  
    • adaptation communications  
Faroe Islands therefore does not as yet meet the requirements for being among the countries counted for the indicator.
