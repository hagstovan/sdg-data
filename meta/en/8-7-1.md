## Text answer  
Child labour includes both ordinary paid and household work.  
In January 2020 0.1% of the 5-11 year olds had more than 1 hour paid work per week, 0.2% of the 13-14 year olds had more than 14 hours paid work per week and 1.0% of the 15-17 year olds had more than 43 hours paid work per week.  
In the population census in 2011 0.5% of the 15-17 year olds stated that they worked more than 30 hours domestic chores.
