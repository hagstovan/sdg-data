Statistics Faroe Islands estimates that very few people, if any, live below the international poverty line. All people in Faroe Islands are entitled to social services that exceed extreme poverty. There is no official poverty line defined for Faroe Islands. Instead risk of poverty is defined as 60 pct. (or 50 pct.) of the median equivalent household income.
This corresponds to more than 300 DKR per day, substansially above $1.25.
