## Text answer  
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) reports the number of countries that have repsectively signed and inforce bilateral investment treaties (BIT) with developing countries, including the least developed countries.  
  
The *UNCTAD IIA Navigator* is a comprehensive free database of international investment agreements (IIAs). It is primarily built on information provided by governments on a voluntary basis, as well as other reliable sources, (https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/international-investment-agreements)  
  
This database contains no agreements including Faroe Islands.
