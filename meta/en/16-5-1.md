The Faroe Islands procudes no regular statistics on bribery and corruption, and Faroe Islands are not part of United Nation Survey of Crime Trends (UN-CTS) that collects data for this indicator. However it is estimated, that Faroe Islands resemble the other Nordic countries all of which belong to the least corrupt countries in the world.
