## Text answer  
Currently Faroe Marine Research Institute is carrying out measurements to describe the ocean carbon system, including pH (acidity, concentration of hydrogen ions) and TA (total alkality).  

With the existing resources it is currently challenging to carry out sufficiently frequent measurements to reliably discriminate natural variability from long-term anthropogenic trends.  

Consequently existing data is not adequate to fully describe the average marine acidity as required for the indicator. However, there is an ongoing effort to acquire funding to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of measurements in the coastal ocean.
